            <h3>My Journey    <i class="fas fa-road"></i></h3>
            
        <section id="texts">
        
            <p>I would like to share my experience on weight loss journey which resulted in losing about 10kg (22lbs).</p>
            <p>You are on this website because other solutions did not work for you or you didn’t get the right results. You have more likely got involved in a strict and unrealistic diet and couldn’t follow. I cannot blame you because I have been there!</p>
            <p>I have investigated a lot and tried many types of diet but most of them are unrealistic. I have realized that pushing yourself to a completely different diet is shocking for your body and mind.</p>
            <p>So I have figured out it is better to get your diet changed slowly. </p>
            <p>For example: If you are using 1 spoon of sugar in your tea it is better to use half spoon on first week, quarter spoon second week and no sugar third week. This applies to any junk food such as chocolates or salty snacks. Therefore, reducing bad foods slowly is the only option for most people (but not too slow). After you ended those habits it will be easy. But keep in mind that even after you removed them from your eating list and took small piece sugary food will make you crave for it all day.</p>
            <p>I don’t want to sound like many others there, but we all agree that there is no magic pill. It is also a different lifestyle which you will benefit for the rest of your life. </p>

            <h3>Wrong Information’s  <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i></h3>
                        
            <p>I have noticed a lot of people out there believing whatever they hear about dieting and it gets stuck on their mind. Unfortunately, they continue to believe those false diets for such a long time and the years go by. </p>
            
            
           <h3>Motivation   <i class="fas fa-brain"></i></h3>
            
            <p>There are a lot of people out there what to do for losing weight. We keep delaying the process when we want to eat unhealthy food and we say I will start tomorrow, few days later or next week. I have talked about this with many friends. We all agreed that best motivation is to picture yourself with great self-confidence and appearance. It truly changes your world and others around you. That is a fact! Also don’t forget about the feeling great every day! </p>
            
            <p>Please read the instructions on <a href="howto.html">How To</a> section where I explained it in a nutshell.
