# weightloss
Hi There, 
Welcome to my page where I shared my journey on weight loss. 
To avoid any copyright issues all pictures on this site belongs to me. 
All texts has been written by myself. 
Menu (navbar): I have decided to go with buttons here with some effects. I found this button type online and I have adjusted it (color, border radius, font) 
Paragraphs : I have used basic html font style.
Background, buttons, logo, sign up box and footer has all been organized with tone of gray color.
I was going to use bootstrap but I decided not to. I wanted to only type my own code but I have used font awesome icons especially for h3 sections.
Top picture: I have used zoom effect as we did in “love running” project.
Bottom of first and second page I have provided link to next page as well inside the paragraph.
Form section on last page I have only requested first name, e mail, male and female options. 
Footer section is with some font awesome icons and I have decided to keep the contact part only for the social media section.
I have made the site responsive but I realized logo is not looking great after submitting only in iPhone 5. I wanted to change it again after deploying again on github but I got system issues. 
Thank you for reviewing!
