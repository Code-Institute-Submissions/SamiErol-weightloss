# PROJECT NAME: WEIGHTLOSS
 
Welcome to my page where I shared my journey on weight loss. 

# UX 
This website is for individuals who are looking to lose weight with realistic program and results provided. Visiters will find motivation and technique for their journey on weight loss. 

# FEATURES
Introduction (Home) section has brief information about myself, wrong informations given to people and motivation. I wanted to get visitors attention with these 3 realistic informations on the first page of the website.

Top pictures on each page: I have used zoom effect as we did in “love running” project.

Contact us section applied at the bottom of every page.

Menu (navbar): I have decided to go with buttons here with some effects. I found this button type online and I have adjusted it (color, border radius, font) 

Background, buttons, logo, sign up box and footer has all been organized with different tones of gray color.

Bottom of first and second page I have provided link to next page as well inside the paragraph.


Second page (How To) is about the weight loss technique that is explained briefly. 

Last page (Free Ebook) is the section where users provide their details to receive the document from me.
