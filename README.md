# Project Name: Weightloss

Welcome to my page where I shared my journey on weight loss.

# Ux
This website is for individuals who are looking to lose weight with realistic program and results provided. Visitors will find motivation and technique for their journey on weight loss. All popular devices are supported, the colour scheme makes for easy readability and the sticky menu means you can change pages quickly.

# Features
Introduction (Home) section has brief information about myself, wrong information given to people and motivation. I wanted to get visitors attention with these 3 realistic pieces of information on the first page of the website.

Top pictures on each page: I have used zoom effect as we did in “love running” project.

Contact us section applied at the bottom of every page. Color change has been applied when hovered over the social media icons.

Menu (navbar): I have decided to go with buttons here with some effects. I found this button type online and I have adjusted it (color, border radius, font). The menu also scrolls down the page as you read for easier accessibility.

Background, buttons, logo, sign up box and footer has all been organized with different tones of gray color.

Bottom of first and second page I have provided link to next page as well inside the paragraph.


Second page (How To) is about the weight loss technique that is explained briefly.

Last page (Free Ebook) is the section where users provide their details to receive the document from me.

# Technologies used

HTML, CSS and Fontawesome has been used for this site. I have avoided using Bootstrap.

# Testing

I have used Chrome inspect to test and visualize how the site looks on different devices. Common phone/tablet sizes render content with good scaling thanks to CSS changes. No user data is stored so security in this area does not have to be tested. I will host on a reputable platform (GitHub pages to ensure stability/security)

# Deployment

I have written my code on different platform and added to Github/Gitpod with the help of online support.

# Content Credits
All text has been written by myself that is on the website. No copy paste from any source.

# Media Credits

All pictures used are taken by myself to avoid copyright violation.

# Acknowledgement

I have been inspired to do this website based on my success and wanting to help others to achieve their goals as well.
